Hi! This is a blog for city planners who wish to better understand changes and challenges in their communities using data and visualizations. We write about common planning problems in areas such as housing, transportation, land use, or economic development and demonstrate how data visualizations can give communities the tools to address emerging issues. Most of these posts will profile techniques in `R`, an open-source sofitware that let's you manipulate and visualize different sources of information.
