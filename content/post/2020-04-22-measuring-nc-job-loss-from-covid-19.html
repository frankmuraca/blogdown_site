<p>Over the past four weeks, more than 20 million people <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/16/business/economy/unemployment-numbers-coronavirus.html">have filed for unenmployment</a> as the country adjusts economic fallout of Covid-19. While we still don’t know the longterm impacts of the pandemic, swift and widespread job loss puts pressure on millions of Americans rising medical, housing, and school-related costs.</p>
<p>In mid-April the Urban Institute <a href="https://datacatalog.urban.org/dataset/estimated-low-income-jobs-lost-covid-19">released new estimates</a> of the number of low-income jobs (&lt;$40k salary) lost as a result of Covid-19. In this post, we’ll use this data to measure job loss in North Carolina while adding some simple Census data for additional context.</p>
<div id="the-data" class="section level2">
<h2>The data!</h2>
<p>The estimates rely on three sources of data - the BLS, Washington State Employment Security Deparment, and 2017 LODES data - to predict job loss counts for every census tract in the US. Washington State publishes weekly unemployment claims by industry sector and are used for this analysis until the BLS releases national unemployment figures by industry in May. The full methodology is <a href="https://github.com/UrbanInstitute/covid-neighborhood-job-analysis">here.</a></p>
<p>The dataset also has a file for job loss by county which we’ll use first.</p>

<p>The file we downloaded includes all the counties in the US. Let’s only select North Carolina. We’ll then visualize the the top 15 counties by total job loss using a <a href="https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/lollipop-plot.html">lollipop plot.</a></p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, job loss is highest in North Carolina’s seven metro counties - with Raleigh and Charlotte accounting for about <strong>20%</strong> of jobs lost in the state. Now let’s see if the same is true when looking at job loss as a <strong>percentage of the overall labor force.</strong></p>
<p>Let’s use the <a href="https://walkerke.github.io/tidycensus/articles/basic-usage.html"><code>tidycensus</code></a> package to pull labor force estimates for each county in the state. If you’re a longtime American Factfinder user (<a href="https://data.census.gov/cedsci/deeplinks?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffactfinder.census.gov%2F&amp;tid=GOVSTIMESERIES.CG00ORG01">RIP</a>), this is a great tool to quickly grab Census data over many years and for different geographies.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<p>Note: The Tidycensus requires an API key, <a href="https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html">which can be acquired here.</a></p>

<p>When we look at job loss as percentage of overall labor force, North Carolina’s more rural counties are hardest hit by the economic fall out of Covid-19. Let’s use the <code>tmap</code> package to compare these two graphs.</p>
