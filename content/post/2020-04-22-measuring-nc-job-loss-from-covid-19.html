<p>Over the past four weeks, more than 20 million people <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/16/business/economy/unemployment-numbers-coronavirus.html">have filed for unenmployment</a> as the country adjusts to the economic fallout of Covid-19. While we still don’t know the longterm impacts of the pandemic, widespread job loss creates an immediate need for Americans without savings to cover their cost of living.</p>
<p>What do we know about the people and places that have been most impacted by the recent shock in unemployment?</p>
<p>In mid-April the Urban Institute <a href="https://datacatalog.urban.org/dataset/estimated-low-income-jobs-lost-covid-19">released new estimates</a> on the number of low-income jobs (&lt;$40k salary) lost as a result of Covid-19. In this post, we’ll use this data to figure out where job loss is most prevalent in North Carolina.</p>
<div id="the-data" class="section level2">
<h2>The data</h2>
<p>The estimates rely on unemployment reports from Washington State and New York State that include job losses by industry. To calculate job loss for Census tracts elsewhere in the country, those estimates are applied to state-level job loss estimates reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The full methodology is <a href="https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/where_low-income_jobs_are_being_lost_to_covid-19_technical_appendix_04232020.pdf">here.</a></p>
<p>The Urban Institute provides two separate files for county and tract estimates. Let’s start with counties:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># We&#39;ll be using the following packages:
library(geojsonsf)
library(sf)
library(tidyverse)
library(hrbrthemes)
library(scales)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># Let&#39;s pull in the county-level data and subset the file to only include counties in North Carolina. We&#39;ll also remove the word &quot;County&quot; from the names to make it more readable later.

county &lt;- geojson_sf(&quot;https://ui-lodes-job-change-public.s3.amazonaws.com/sum_job_loss_county.geojson&quot;) %&gt;% 
  filter(state_name==&quot;North Carolina&quot;) %&gt;%
  mutate(county_name = str_remove(county_name,&quot; County&quot;))

<p>Unsurprisingly, job loss is highest in North Carolina’s seven metro counties - with Raleigh and Charlotte accounting for about <strong>20%</strong> of jobs lost in the state. Now let’s see if the same is true when looking at job loss as a <strong>percentage of the overall labor force.</strong></p>
<p>Let’s use the <a href="https://walkerke.github.io/tidycensus/articles/basic-usage.html"><code>tidycensus</code></a> package to pull labor force estimates for each county in the state. If you’re a longtime American Factfinder user (<a href="https://data.census.gov/cedsci/deeplinks?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffactfinder.census.gov%2F&amp;tid=GOVSTIMESERIES.CG00ORG01">RIP</a>), this is a great tool to quickly grab Census data over many years and for different geographies.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The Tidycensus requires an API key, <a href="https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html">which can be acquired here.</a></p>

<p>When we look at job loss as percentage of overall labor force, North Carolina’s more rural counties are hardest hit by the economic fall out of Covid-19. Let’s use the <code>tmap</code> package to visualize the difference in these two metrics.</p>

<p>Not all industries are equally impacted by the pandemic. Food, hospitality, retail, and some health care subsectors have had to cut back or stop operations to help slow the spread of Covid-19. In North Carolina, over 140,000 of the low-income jobs lost occurred in food &amp; accomodation industries, and nearly 90,000 were lost in retail industries.</p>

<p>Up until now, we’ve been looking at state and county-wide job loss. What about at the neighborhood level? The Urban Institute also provides estimates for low-income job loss for Census tracts. Let’s download that data and look the relationship between job loss and tract poverty rate. Many of these steps will be repeated from the county data.</p>

<p>Census tracts with higher poverty rates tend to have higher levels of low-income job loss. Based on research from other counties, we know that low-income individuals <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/world/europe/coronavirus-inequality.html">are more likely to contract and die from Covid-19</a>. This initial look at job loss also shows that the economic impacts of the virus are also more severe in high-poverty areas. This insight should help policymakers direct both <em>health</em> and <em>economic recovery</em> resources <a href="https://shelterforce.org/2020/03/24/housing-policy-must-change-in-wake-of-covid-19/">to these hardest hit communities.</a></p>
