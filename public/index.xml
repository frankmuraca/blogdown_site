      <description>Over the past four weeks, more than 20 million people have filed for unenmployment as the country adjusts to the economic fallout of Covid-19. While we still donâ€™t know the longterm impacts of the pandemic, widespread job loss creates an immediate need for Americans without savings to cover their cost of living.
What do we know about the people and places that have been most impacted by the recent shock in unemployment?</description>

      <description>Hi! This is a website for city planners who wish to better understand changes and challenges in their communities using data analysis and visualizations. We write about common planning problems in areas such as housing, transportation, land use, or economic development and demonstrate how data visualizations can give communities tools to address emerging issues. Most of these posts will profile techniques in R, an open-source software that let&amp;rsquo;s you manipulate and visualize different sources of information.</description>
